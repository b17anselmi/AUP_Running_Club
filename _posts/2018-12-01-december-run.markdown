**Date:** 01/12/18

**Time:** 12:00-1:30

**Location:** Parc des Buttes Chaumont,


&nbsp;


Suggested by one of our regular club members, the Parc des Buttes Chaumont is a beautiful running location. Come join us on December first for change of scenery away from the 7th and start your December off right.

We'll be meeting between 12:00-12:30 on the north side of the lake (shown on the map). We'll probably run for 30-45 minutes depending on everyone's goals. Remember there's no place for us to leave bags like on our normal runs, so what you come with you run with.

*Hope to see you there!*
