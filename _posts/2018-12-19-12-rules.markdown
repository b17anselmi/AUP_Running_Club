Dr. Jordan B. Peterson's bestselling book 12 Rules for Life has become incredibly popular in the 11 months since its release. The book is not your typical self help, feel good confidence booster. It's pragmatic, complex, and thorough, with lessons from how to hold yourself to how to heal your broken relationships.

I discovered Dr. Peterson over spring break of 2018, and finished reading his book while on fall break some 7 months later. His rules can be applied to improving nearly every area of our lives, including running. Here is a parody of the rules, in light of our hobby.

&nbsp;

**Rule 1: Run Straight With Your Shoulders Back**

*Original: Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulders Back*

Good posture and form are important in any everyday task, not just while we're on the road. This rule runs deeper than the physiological benefits of standing tall though. Dr. Peterson makes the case that when you stand tall, you are signaling to your brain that you are in the top of a hierarchy. You are prepared to take on the burden of the world with courage and confidence.

For my fellow female runners especially, how you hold yourself is important. Running can be risky, particularly in a big city like Paris. It's important that you run with confidence and assertion. Looking like you shouldn't be messed with will signal to any trouble makers to stay out of your path and that if they do cross you there will be serious consequences.

So take some pride in your running and run tall with your shoulders back. You've got some miles ahead of you, and you're ready for them.

**Rule 2: Treat Yourself Like An Athlete You're Coaching**

*Original: Treat Yourself Like Someone You're Responsible For Helping*

We all know that we're much harder on ourselves than other people. We know exactly where we're failing, exactly where we could be better, and frequently exactly *how* we could be better. Running is a touch mental game, particularly if you have very specific goals you're aiming towards (see Rule 10). It's easy to beat ourselves up or push through pain because we think we need to "toughen up".

I've had club members ask me if they should run when they're sick. Our first run I had a 100.0 degree fever and was shivering in a cold sweat my entire 3 miles. My advice is always "Do what is kind for your body and brain." For me personally working out when I have a cold makes me feel better, but I'm very gentle with myself and will accept the bare minimum of what my body can give me. For some people it's better to catch a nap rather than a run. The important thing is to listen to your body, mind, and soul not only when you're sick but all the time. Give yourself the foods, movement, rest, and encouragement that make you feel good and perform well.

In other words, treat yourself like an athlete you're coaching.

**Rule 3: Find Running Buddies Who Want The Best For You**

*Original: Make Friends With People Who Want The Best For You*

Not everyone likes to run with other people. Even in our club most members don't run in groups. For a lot of people though a workout buddy or two is a great thing. I created this club to provide a community, a place where students could get to know each other and have an opportunity to run. We share each other's successes, failures, and turn our minds away from school at least once a week to sweat a little.

Having a supportive community of people who want you to do better is incredibly important. That's the type of community many students find in their classmates at AUP, and it's the type of community we're cultivating in the running club. After your time with our club and/or at AUP, be sure if you have running buddies, they always want the best for you.

**Rule 4: Try To Beat Who You Were Yesterday, Not Who Someone Else Is Today**

*Original: Compare Yourself To Who You Were Yesterday, Not Who Someone Else Is Today*

The comparison trap is one we've all fallen into at some point. Whether it was with grades on a test or average mile pace, it's easy to compare ourselves to other people and feel inferior because of that.

I recently wrote a [blog post]({%post_url 2018-11-18-racing-in-france%}) about racing here in France. For me, the point of racing is not to beat other people, it's to try and improve my own time, testing my own body. I have no control over anyone else's training, genetic advantages, or natural talent. All I can control is my mindset and preparation. On our first run when I was sick (see Rule 2) one of our members' who had never run consistently before had an average mile pace that was 3 minutes faster than mine, and I had over 100 miles of experience on her. To this day she is still significantly faster than I am simply because of how our bodies are built. It doesn't even phase me though, because I'm not competing with her. Every week I'm trying to beat my time, I'm only comparing myself to who I was, not who someone else is.

**Rule 5: Do Not Let Your Supporters Do Anything That Makes You Dislike Them**

*Original: Do Not Let Your Children Do Anything That Makes You Dislike Them*

*Disclaimer: Obviously you can't control everyone's actions or attitudes, however "supporters" refers to your close network, specifically anyone who knows what running means to you.*

In this rule, Dr. Peterson goes into a lot of detail about how to parent. Obviously that's not terribly applicable to most of us, but when you're chasing high goals, you have to cultivate an environment that will facilitate that as much as possible. We've already seen a rule about choosing running buddies, but what about those people in your life who don't run with you?

Anecdote 1: One day I was up at 5:00 am to go lift and my friend back in the states gave me a call.

Friend: "Why are you awake?"

Me: "I'm going to the gym."

Friend: "No, don't go to the gym, go back to bed."

**Rule 6:**

*Original: Set Your House In Perfect Order Before You Criticize The World*

&nbsp;

**Rule 7: Pursue What Is Sustainable (Not What is Expedient)**

*Original: Pursue What Is Meaningful (Not What is Expedient)*

&nbsp;

**Rule 8: Be Honest With Yourself**

*Original: Tell The Truth - Or At Least Don't Lie*

&nbsp;

**Rule 9: Listen And Learn From Everyone**

*Original: Assume That The Person You're Listening To Might Know Something You Don't*

&nbsp;

**Rule 10: Be Precise In Your Goals**

*Original: Be Precise In Your Speech*

&nbsp;

**Rule 11: Run and Let Run**

*Original: Do Not Bother Children When They Are Skateboarding*

When I did my first race in France, it was a mud run for women only. I trained and stressed out about it for months, battling shin splints and performance plateaus galore. Well meaning friends were telling me all about their mud run experiences, and the more I heard the more intimidated I got.

Fast forward to the day of the race. I'm on the train at 10:00 am, and across from me are two girls drinking beers. Fair enough, to each their own. Then they got off the train and walked ahead of me to the race. I'd heard of "carb loading" before a competition, but beer? Really?

The other participants were taking the event about as seriously as those two. Large groups of French women in pink and glitter were all drinking, eating from food trucks, and meandering through the obstacle course. I was disoriented to say the least. Here I had been, stressing out about crawling under barbed wire and getting over walls to test myself physically, and these women were using the race as an excuse to day drink and get glittered up and filthy with their girlfriends.

My initial reaction was dismay, obviously no one else was taking it seriously. I frequently struggle with judging people who I think aren't working (or haven't worked) as hard as me. However I needed to remember Rule 11. Every single one of those women, short tall, thin or curvy, ran, walked, or jogged 3.1 miles. We all dove through freezing muddy water, we all climbed up nets and over walls. We all got out and moved, and for those groups of women they all spent a great day with their friends and families, something I didn't have the opportunity to do.

So the next time you're tempted to judge the way someone else is training or feel superior because you're more hardcore than anyone around you, just run and let run.

**Rule 12: Pet The Dog That Says Hello On Your Run**

*Original: Pet A Cat When You Encounter One On The Street*
