Every runner, young or old, experienced or novice, has a reason why they lace up their shoes every single run. For some maybe it's the pursuit of health, for others maybe it's the joy of spending time with your friends, and some people are chasing after goals. I'm not talking about ill defined, "I want to feel healthy" goals (although that's a great place for a lot of people to start). I'm talking about specific, non-negotiable "I want to run a 5k in 21 minutes or less" goals.

If you're a goal oriented runner like me, racing can be a great way to have a day marked on your calendar that you have to get to in tip top condition. You can't back out of it, and besides, it gives you something to look forward to! A new run with new people in a new location, what's not to be excited about?

Finding races to do in Paris isn't always easy. Just searching "5k France" in Google won't always give you what you're looking for, and if it does the websites are usually all in French, which can be tricky to navigate if you're not comfortable with the language. In this post, we'll be going over how to find races all over France, and what you'll need to participate.

## Find Your Race

While straight Google searching doesn't always work, there are some websites out there that list races by location. For example, [Jogging Plus](http://www.jogging-plus.com/calendrier/courses-5-10-15-km/ile-de-france/) has a great calendar of 5, 10, and 15 km races in and around Paris. You can find a race listed for pretty much any date or location you could want here.

If you're interested in running outside of France, another tip is to look up info about big marathons and other races. For example the Amsterdam marathon is a huge event, and they have half marathon and 8km route options. The Paris marathon does not have shorter route options, but there are plenty of separate shorter distance races on other days.

Another way to find races is via social media. The first 5k I did here was a mud run that my friend tagged me in on Instagram. More commercialized races have a lot of social media marketing, so it's not too hard to find fun races like the [Muddy Angel run](https://en.muddyangelrun.com), [Spartan race](http://www.spartanrace.fr/fr), or the [Paris Half Marathon](http://www.harmoniemutuellesemideparis.com/en).

## How To Participate


To race in France, you'll need to get a medical certificate from a general practitioner. This is the same certificate you need
<img style="float:left; width: 50%; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px;" src="/assets/racingEnd.png"> to be on one of the competitive sports teams at AUP. Getting the certificate is incredibly simple. You can just visit the [Health Office](https://www.aup.edu/student-life/support/health-wellness/contact) at school or make an appointment yourself with a [general practitioner](https://www.aup.edu/student-life/support/health-wellness/medical-providers#GeneralPracticioners) (Dr. Patricia Nizard is a favorite around school and her office is just a few minutes walk from campus). Once there they'll ask you some questions about your family medical history, fitness level, take your vitals, have you do 20 air squats, then take your vitals again and sign the certificate if everything looks good.

*Tip: On the certificate the doctor indicates which sports you're approved for, so if you're interested in doing something other than running (such as joining a competitive team) you'll need to have them write that you're cleared for that activity too. One easy way to do this is just have them write "multi sport" on the certificate.*

Now that you have your certificate it's good for a whole year, so don't lose it or let anyone keep it! Some races ask you to upload a picture of the certificate when you register, and you'll have to bring it on race day along with some identifying information (residency card, passport, etc).
