If you've been running for a while, or even just been reading about running on the internet, chances are you've heard of cross-training. It's simply when an athlete does an activity different from their main sport to strengthen and improve performance in their primary discipline. For example, Olympic bobsledders will spend hours a day lifting and sprinting to get their bodies ready to push a sled down an icy track. While they're at training camps, they only do one or two runs a day, but they'll still spend 8 or more hours training in different ways so that they're ready to compete at an international level.

For runners there's only so many hours a day we can spend pounding pavement, and there's only so many miles a week we can cover before our bodies (particularly for new runners) start to protest. If you have performance goals or are just looking to spend more time moving your body, it might be time to consider some cross-training. This article will be the first in a series about different cross-training methods and how you can incorporate them into your training plan while living in Paris.

## Swimming

Swimming is a fantastic way to cross-train. Impact is one of the things new runners often struggle with, and in swimming there's virtually no impact or harsh treatment to your joints. If you have shin splints or tightness anywhere in your body, swimming can also help you loosen up and workout painful areas. The cool water helps with lactic acid buildup in sore muscles and it's a great way to relax. There's also very little risk of injury, even if you're not an expert. With biking there's always the chance of a crash, or with lifting you might strain something if you go too heavy or have poor technique. Swimming is a great, safe way to workout when you don't feel like being on dry land anymore.

 While in some ways working out in France is harder than in the States, Paris is a great place to swim, with dozens and dozens of pools scattered across the city. In the U.S. you might have to pay $10.00 to use the pool at your local rec center, but they have a very different model in Paris. Pools are incredibly cheap, numerous, and sometimes crowded, but it's not too hard to find a time when the lanes won't be too packed with Parisians.

## Where can you swim in Paris?
 **[Official Website](https://www.paris.fr/equipements/piscines)**
 All the locations are listed on this site, and then each pool has a page with its hours (updated regularly), facilities, classes, and any other relevant information listed.

#### Cost (reduced rate for EU residents under 26):
* 1 visit - 2 euros
* 10 visit pass - 16 euros
* 3 month pass - 22 euros
For passes, you’ll need to bring an identifying document (such as your residency card, proving that you’re an EU resident if you want the reduced rate) and an ID photo (available from photo booths around the city). It’s definitely a worthwhile investment if you’re planning on swimming a lot though.

#### Some things to know:
* Some pools are outside, some inside, some have both. Outside and inside pools are very warm year round though.
* Hours vary by pool and season, so be sure to check the website before heading out to take a dip. Cash registers close 45 minutes before the pool does and they start clearing the lanes 30 minutes before closing.
* Early morning, midday, and the evenings are when most pools are busiest, so if you don’t want to swim with a packed lane skip those times.
* Some pools have classes available (Aquagym, water jogging, etc). Be sure to check out your pool’s page to see class times and availability.
* Most pools have vending machines with suits, caps, goggles, and any other equipment you may need.
* Swim caps are required (available in the vending machines or cheap at any sports store).
* Gentlemen: Bermuda shorts (swim trunks) are not allowed.
* Typically coed locker rooms/showers.
* Sometimes the locks take a 1 or 2 euro coin to lock, so be sure to have change on you the first time you check out a new location.
* Some pools have kick boards, pull buoys, float belts, etc available if you want to switch up swimming laps.

So next time you're looking to give your legs a break from the wear and tear of the city cobblestones, grab your suit and head to the nearest pool! Almost any type of workout you would do on the road can be done in the water, intervals, recovery, endurance, etc. Be sure to take advantage of the great opportunity Paris pools provide!
