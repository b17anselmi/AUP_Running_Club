Here are the answers to some questions about the club we frequently get.

&nbsp;


#### **Where/when/how far do you guys run?**

Our current route is along the Seine, starting by Combes. Check out our events page or social media for specific details about the route and our meeting times for the present semester.

#### **Is there a fee to join?**

Nope! We're a recreational club, no fees or **medical certificate** needed.

#### **Is it really hard?**

Not unless you make it that way. Everyone does their own thing on our runs, some people in groups, some people solo. If you want to run long and hard go for it, but most club members keep things pretty laid back.

#### **Do you compete/race?**

No, again we're a recreational club. However some members do race throughout the semester and we try to have one race advertised at the end of each semester in case anyone's interested. So no, as a club we don't race, but if you're interested in doing so we can help you make it happen!
